# Investment-Factors
By applying machine learning methods and predictive analysis into the Equity and Corporate Bond markets, I developed quantitative investment factors under the finance framework, including fundamental analysis for investees' financial situations and technical analysis for the trend of their stock prices. Based on computed factors, I also build grouped portfolios and evaluate their performance with visualization tools.
